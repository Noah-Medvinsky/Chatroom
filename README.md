How to install:
1. cd into chatroom run npm install firebase, npm update
2.  cd into server 2, here you will need to run npm update, please run npm install express if npm update fails to install node express

3. CD into public and then webpack-demo, run npm update here
4. Now everything should go configured and installed, you will want to go to the directory called Server2 and run the command node app.js!



The files we used to test include BLACK BOX TESTING Chatroom.txt, testFirebase.js (these two are in the root directory) and index.test.js which is under Chatroom/server2/public/webpack-demo
/src/
